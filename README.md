# 🔁 Recap
## 🧠 AI-Powered Daily Reflection & Insight System

* Recap is a minimal, AI-driven reflection product that helps users understand their days, identify patterns, and build consistency through short daily inputs and intelligent summaries.

    This project is built as a real SaaS-style product foundation, not a demo.

❌ Journaling feels time-consuming
